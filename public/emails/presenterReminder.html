  <span> Thank you again for signing up to be a presenter at the upcoming Philly Crit! Please confirm by return email that you still plan to present your work on ||EVENT_DATE||. If your plans have changed,</span>
  <span class="crucial">it is crucial that you let us know as soon as possible</span>
  <span>so that we can make your spot available to someone else.</span>
</div>
<div>
  <span> If you are still planning to present,</span>
  <span class="crucial"> please email us a photo of your work</span>
  <span> if you not have already done so.</span>
  <span class="crucial"> Time is of the essence.</span>
  <span> As mentioned in our previous email, we will be using this image to promote your work on our social media. We will also include it in our email announcing the crit.</span>

<p>
  Seeing a group of work is sometimes more revealing and can spark more conversation, so you might consider bringing up to 5 works, depending on size. We also suggest that you bring work made within the last year or so.
</p>
<p>
  We will soon be sharing day-of information, but donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any questions in the meantime. A reminder of our presenter guidelines can be found <a href="https://phillycrit.com/communityGuidelines">here</a>.

<p>
  We look forward to seeing you soon!
