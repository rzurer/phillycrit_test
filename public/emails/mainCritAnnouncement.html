Please enter via the side/West school entrance of the building through Lenfest Plaza near Cherry Street. Refrain from entering via the front Broad Street museum entrance. When you arrive in the West Lobby, you will be checked in by Kate McCammon (number listed below) and will need to sign in at the desk. Please have an ID with you so front desk staff can sign you in. You will then be directed to take the elevator to the crit floor.

  As mentioned on our site, only people who have signed up for the crit can attend. If you are an attendee (and not a presenter), please arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the crit start time. If you are a presenter, please arrive within 30 minutes of the crit start time to set up your work.

  If you are presenting and have large artworks, please note that PAFA has a loading dock, freight elevator, and available carts. If you need assistance offloading your work from your vehicle, please pull up behind the Hamilton Building on Carlisle Street, where there is a space to pull up on the sidewalk near the loading dock. You may enter "115 N. Carlisle Street" into your GPS to direct you to the loading area. Note that Carlisle Street is not a parking zone and your vehicle should not remain near the dock for too long. When you arrive, please contact a Philly Crit coordinator, who can assist you.
