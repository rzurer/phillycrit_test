  Thank you for signing up for our upcoming crit on ||EVENT_DATE|| at PAFA.

  We are thrilled to announce that our crit is now at capacity. As of the date of this email there are ||NUMBER_WAITING|| people waiting to attend. If you think that there is any chance that you will no longer be able to make it at 10 AM on Sunday, would you please let us know as soon as possible so that we may give your spot to someone else?
