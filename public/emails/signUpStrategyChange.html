  Dear Philly Crit community,
</p>
<p>
  As we are well into our second summer since our initial Philly Crit relaunch, we’ve cultivated engaging and dynamic critiques. Month after month, this continues to be possible thanks to all of you–presenters, attendees, friends, and beyond–who consistently make Philly Crit the thriving and connecting artist community it has become.
</p>
<p>
  Due to our attendance limitations and the first-come first-serve nature of the current signup procedure, we have found that newcomers and infrequent participants have had difficulty signing up. Therefore, beginning with the September critique, we are providing a means for these folks to sign up early. For the September critique signup, they will be allotted 10 slots during a designated pre-registration period. If you are a regular attendee, you will be prompted to wait three days after the announcement of the crit to sign up.
</p>
<p>
  Our hope is that this strategy offers even more community engagement and opportunities for new members to share in the vibrant space we’ve all helped foster. Many thanks for your continued support.
