  In response some great feedback we received, we've added new features to our website.
</p>
<p>
  When anyone visits the site they are now greeted by a splash screen which promotes current and upcoming member exhibits.

  To make it easier to publish your own news, we've added an entry form. You log into the site and click the 'Submit News' menu to fill out the entry form. Then simply click 'Publish' and your news will go live in about a day or so. It will stay up until the closing date that you specify.

  It was also suggested that it would be helpful to be able to see those who presented or attended our past crits. To this end we have added a 'View All Crits' menu which brings up a drop down containing the dates of all crits. Selecting a date will display a table of all those who attended that crit along with links to their social media accounts.
