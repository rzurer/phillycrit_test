  We currently have three presenter spots open at our crit on Sunday March 9, 2025. We would like to provide an opportunity for those of you who may have wanted to present but have not been able to do so.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to present your work at the March crit, please reply to this message and say so. Even though we have capped attendee-only sign up, we will allow you to join in order to present.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure if you want to present, take heart that the crits have given great support to presenters and that this unique opportunity to share and discuss work has filled the cup of many. And know that we depend upon you, our community, to sustain us both by presenting and by attending.
</p>

<p>
  We also want all of you to know we will soon make it easier for those who want to present, to sign up.
</p>
<p>
  Please feel free to email us any questions that you might have.
</p>
<p>
  We look forward to seeing you in the future
