<p>Philly Crit provides a free monthly space for Philadelphia-based artists to come together to share and discuss their artwork. It fosters an atmosphere of constructive peer-to-peer criticism free of judgment and hierarchy.</p>
<p>We welcome a diversity of voices, mediums, artistic skills, and projects in different stages of completion. It is our core belief that every artist has something to offer regardless of skill level or educational background. </p>
<p>We aim to expand formal, thematic, and material conversations surrounding the artwork and to promote artists, share resources, and connect artists to one another within the Philly art community. We believe in the power of community and collective learning, and meeting artists where they are in order to best support their growth.</p>
