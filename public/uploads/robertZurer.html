    <b>Robert Zurer</b> (he, him), b. 1948, New York, NY
  </p>
  <p class='bioParagraph'>
    Zurerâ€™s childhood friends were the offspring of parents active in the creative community of Greenwich Village in the 1950s. He started drawing at a young age, when he and his father played a game wherein his father scribbled some lines on paper and asked him to make a drawing out of them. Decades later, this kind of automatic drawing remains a starting point for many of his paintings.
