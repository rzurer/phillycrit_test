  Four artists will each receive a 25-minute critique of their work. Signing up to present will be on a first-come, first-served basis and presenters will be asked to fill out a short informational questionnaire. In order to give as many artists as possible the opportunity to present, you must wait four months before signing up to present again.

  The sign-up for presenters will be opened about two months prior to the crit. The sign-up for attendees will be opened about one month prior to the crit; during which time, an early signup will be provided for newcomers and infrequent attendees. Announcements for the opening of these sign-ups will be emailed and posted on our Instagram account.
