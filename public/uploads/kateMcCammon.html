    Kate McCammon is a Philadelphia-based mixed media artist. She earned her BFA in Painting from the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore in 2012 and MFA in Studio Art from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia in 2016. Her work has been displayed in a number of group exhibitions, including shows at First Street Gallery in New York City, NY; Gross McCleaf Gallery in Philadelphia, PA; and at The Art Trust in West Chester, PA; among others. In 2020 and 2021, she had solo exhibitions at AUTOMAT Gallery in Philadelphia and at Curio. Gallery & Creative Supply in Lancaster, PA. Her work has also been featured in Maake Magazine, Issue 16. Currently working in photo collage and exploring themes around identity, loss, and memory, she has been creating an installation she refers to as “Journal Portraits”, a series of small-scale portraits that are inspired by personal journals and family photos.
