    <b>Albert Fung</b> (he, him) b. 1970, San Francisco, CA
  </p>
  <p class='bioParagraph'>
    Albert Fung’s work is meaningful when it rings like a bell, shocks like the new, and bothers like memory. It is like remembering what you forgot you never knew. His work is kinesthetic and synaesthetic: a sensation of color leaves a taste in one’s mouth; pictorial rhythms land like body blows.
